# StakeWithFriends

StakeWithFriends is a mobile-first PWA for funded 1v1 USDC pacts on Arc Testnet. Users sign in, fund a vault, create or join eFootball, Chess, or custom pacts, upload result evidence, chat with the other participant, and resolve payouts on-chain.

Use Node.js `>=22 <24`. The API also needs Python 3, [apps/api/requirements.txt](apps/api/requirements.txt), and the native `tesseract-ocr` binary when eFootball result detection is enabled.

## Stack

- React, Vite, Tailwind, and PWA caching
- Privy login plus wallet-extension and WalletConnect/Reown wallet support
- `viem` for Arc Testnet reads and writes
- Node API service for indexed reads, pact chat, uploads, OCR, and keeper jobs
- Supabase Postgres for app data and indexed read models
- Supabase Storage S3-compatible uploads for evidence files
- `efootball-ocr` with Tesseract OCR and optional Ollama or OpenAI vision fallback
- Hardhat contract workspace

Contract tests deploy a tiny test ERC20 from the test helpers. Testnet deployments should use the Arc Testnet USDC ERC-20 interface address.

## Quick Start

1. Install JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install OCR dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv apps/api/.venv
apps/api/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt
```

Install `tesseract-ocr` on the API host as well. On macOS that is usually `brew install tesseract`; on Linux hosts use the host package manager or the API Dockerfile.

3. Copy env files.

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp contracts/.env.example contracts/.env
```

4. Fill in Arc contract addresses, Supabase, Privy, and storage settings.

5. Run the API and web app in two terminals.

```bash
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:web
```

The web app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default. The API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev:web
npm run dev:api
npm run api:indexer
npm run api:indexer:once
npm run build:web
npm run test:web
npm run test:api
npm run contracts:compile
npm run contracts:test
npm run contracts:deploy
npm run contracts:deploy:username-registry
```

## Environment

### `apps/web/.env`

```env
VITE_CHAIN_ID=5042002
VITE_RPC_URL=/rpc/arc
VITE_STABLECOIN_ADDRESS=0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000

ARC_RPC_UPSTREAM_URL=https://rpc.quicknode.testnet.arc.network
VITE_API_UPSTREAM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
VITE_API_BASE_URL=
```

`VITE_RPC_URL=/rpc/arc` keeps browser chain reads same-origin. `VITE_API_UPSTREAM_URL` is only used by the local Vite proxy. Leave `VITE_API_BASE_URL` empty locally to use `/api`; set it to a full API base URL such as `https://stakeswithfriends.onrender.com/api` when the browser should call the API host directly.

The API requires `DATABASE_URL`; local SQLite is no longer used. Keep Supabase service role keys, storage secrets, Privy secrets, and keeper private keys in local env files or deployment secret stores only.

Render sets `PORT` automatically. The API prefers `PORT` over `API_PORT`, and `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` lets Render detect the open web-service port. If Render logs `127.0.0.1:8787`, remove any `API_HOST=127.0.0.1` override from the Render service or set it to `0.0.0.0`, then redeploy the latest commit.

### `contracts/.env`

```env
ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
PACT_ADMIN_ADDRESS=0xYourAdminWallet
PACT_STABLECOIN_ADDRESS=0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000
PACT_MIN_STAKE_UNITS=1000000
PACT_FEE_RECIPIENT=0xYourFeeRecipient
PACT_FEE_BPS=0
```

Pass deployer keys only at runtime:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your-deployer-private-key npm run contracts:deploy
PRIVATE_KEY=your-deployer-private-key npm run contracts:deploy:username-registry
```

## Deployment Notes

- Deploy the API separately from the static web app, for example on Render or another Node host.
- On Render, prefer Docker for the API: set `Root Directory: apps/api`, use the Docker runtime, and point Render at [apps/api/Dockerfile](apps/api/Dockerfile). The Dockerfile installs Node, Python, FFmpeg, and `tesseract-ocr`.
- If you use a native Render Node service instead, the API can start, but eFootball OCR will fail unless you provide a working Tesseract binary yourself. Render native services do not include `tesseract-ocr` by default.
- The API host must have `DATABASE_URL`, Arc RPC, contract addresses, Privy server credentials, Supabase Storage credentials, FFmpeg, Tesseract OCR, and Python OCR dependencies available.
- On Vercel, deploy from the repository root. The root [vercel.json](vercel.json) runs `npm run build:web` and publishes `apps/web/dist`.
- Set Vercel `API_UPSTREAM_URL` to the API hostname only, without `https://`, without `/api`, and without a trailing slash. Example: `stakewithfriends-api.onrender.com`.
- If Vercel returns `DNS_HOSTNAME_NOT_FOUND` or `NOT_FOUND` for `/api/*`, `API_UPSTREAM_URL` is missing or malformed. Save the hostname-only Render value for Production, Preview, and Development as needed, then redeploy.
- To bypass Vercel API rewrites entirely, set Vercel `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://stakeswithfriends.onrender.com/api`; the production web app also falls back to that Render API host on non-local browser hosts.
- Keep frontend private keys out of Vercel. The web app only needs public Vite env values.
- Keep `VITE_RPC_URL=/rpc/arc` so browser RPC reads use the same-domain Arc rewrite.
- Timed autonomous settlement needs the API keeper running with `AUTONOMOUS_KEEPER_ENABLED=true` and a funded keeper key supplied from secrets.
- By default `AI_ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=ocr-only`; set it to `ollama`, `openai`, or `auto` only when that fallback is actually deployed and reachable from the API host.

## Evidence And Chat

- Pact chat is persisted through the API and Supabase Postgres.
- Posting chat uses the signed-in Privy identity when available and can fall back to a one-time wallet signature.
- Evidence uploads go through the API, are validated, compressed with FFmpeg, and stored through Supabase Storage.
- eFootball pacts require a final-result screenshot before result submission. The API reads common eFootball result layouts and maps the detected winner to the pact participants.
- Chess pacts capture player color instead of an in-game username and use the normal declaration flow.
- Legacy external evidence links may still appear in older indexed evidence history, but new managed uploads use Supabase Storage.

## Pact Lifecycle

1. `Created`
   Creator creates the pact and their stake is reserved immediately.
2. `Active`
   Counterparty joins, locks matching stake, and starts the event timer.
3. `Declaration`
   When the event duration ends, the declaration window opens.
4. `Auto split`
   If neither side declares before the declaration window closes, the keeper settles the pact to a split.
5. `Lone declaration review`
   If only one side declares, the other side has the review period to agree, dispute, or submit their own result.
6. `Auto win for lone declaration`
   If the review period ends silently, either participant or the keeper can settle to the declaring winner.
7. `Matched declarations`
   If both sides declare the same winner, the pact can settle immediately.
8. `Dispute`
   Conflicting declarations or challenged lone results move to arbiter review.
9. `Withdraw`
   Resolved funds remain in vault balances until withdrawn.

## Core Contracts

- `ProtocolControl`: admin roles and pause control
- `PactVault`: deposits, reserved stake, payouts, fee snapshots, and splits
- `PactManager`: create, join, cancel, minimum stake, and pact state
- `SubmissionManager`: winner declarations
- `PactResolutionManager`: settlement, disputes, review periods, and arbiter resolution
- `UsernameRegistry`: wallet-to-username lookup

## Validation

Run the relevant checks before deployment:

```bash
npm run build:web
npm run test:web
npm run test:api
npm run contracts:test
```
